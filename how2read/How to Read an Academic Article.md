### 正文
Scholars write academic articles to share their ideas with their peers, usually within their own academic discipline 
(e.g., physics, literature, psychology). Because they already share a highly specialized background, they often assume 
that their readers already understand some of the fundamental knowledge of the field as well as the jargon, which is the 
"the technical terminology(术语) or characteristic idiom(行业习语) of a special activity or group," according to the 
Merriam-Webster Dictionary.

Students typically do not yet share the specialized knowledge or the jargon(行话). The way they learn these things is 
the same way the scholars themselves did: they expose themselves to it and struggle with it over time. Your teachers 
have selected readings that they feel will challenge you to grow intellectually. They usually do not choose readings 
that they think you will easily comprehend. If the readings were easy, you would not need to be in college to work on 
them! You therefore are normal and justified in your feelings of frustration or intimidation(恐吓) when you encounter a 
seemingly difficult or arcane(奥术) text. The good news is that you are reading the article in a class that will help you 
grapple(抓钩) with it. Your teacher and your fellow students are working on it with you in a collaborative(合作的) environment. 
For the exercise to be most fruitful, though, students must do their best to understand the article as much as possible,
 so when they convene(召开) in class, they can contribute to the discussion.

To help you get the most out of a scholarly article, Dr. Becky Rosenberg, former Director of the UWB Teaching and 
Learning Center and former Director of the UWB Writing Center, has written the following guide to approaching a 
scholarly text. Use this guide each time you read an academic text until it becomes second nature.


I. Find the Claim(主张):
One of the keys to finding your way through the specialized and often dense texts produced by scholars is remembering 
that somewhere early in the text the writer needs to tell the reader how his or her study contributes something 
original to the scholarship on the subject. It may be a correction(更正) of some past misunderstanding; it may be the 
inclusion of some consideration(考虑) or variable that previous researchers have missed; it may be applying a theory or 
concept in a new way or in a place it has not previously been used. Make it your first goal to find that claim. Once 
you know that claim, you will be better able to understand the author's choices, and better able to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the argument.

Another key is that academic language is subtle(微妙的), understated. Scholars rarely exhort(告诫) readers adamantly(坚定地) to reject the 
lousy(糟糕) scholarship of those who came before and see the brilliance(光彩) of their fresh new positions. You therefore need to 
be very attentive(细心) to small rhetorical(修辞的) signs like "but" and "although."

While close reading for these subtle rhetorical roadmaps, use the following questions to guide you in locating the claim:

1. What question does the author pose? This typically is implied(默认的) rather than stated explicitly(明确的), so you might be 
searching for something that is not literally in the text.

2. Thesis/position/argument/claim

- What is the primary argument made by the author?
- Where do you first find the argument?
- What language indicates(表示) to you that this is the primary argument?
3. Context

- Why is the argument significant?
- What other positions does the author indicate are debated(辩论) regarding the topic?
- When was the article written? Where was it published? Who was the intended audience?
II. Assess the strength/validity of the argument:
Again, you will need to use close reading skills to uncover the nuances(细微差别) of the argument and to evaluate its 
effectiveness in making its claims and engaging with other positions. For example, notice how the writer introduces 
evidence in support of his or her claim. Does the writer simply say, "Many literary scholars have argued unconvincingly(令人信服的) 
that Hester Prynne's return to Salem in the end of The Scarlet Letter attests to Hawthorne's anti-feminist attitude 
toward women artists"? Or does the writer engage the theses of specific literary scholars who, no doubt, have their 
own nuanced readings? In some cases, the argument that gives attention to the complexity of a few other arguments 
(rather than generically referencing "many scholars" or "studies that show") can produce the more complex and subtle 
claims. Then again, sometimes writers must generalize in order to distinguish themselves more broadly from others. If 
they get too hung up on subtle points of differentiation between their arguments and those of others, **the significance 
of their claims may get lost in the trees**. Be aware of the relative effectiveness or ineffectiveness of either approach, 
depending upon the scope of the argument.

While continuing to close read for the subtle rhetorical ways in which the writer builds his or her case, use the 
following questions to help you sort out the building blocks of the writer's argument:

1. Evidence

- What evidence does the author offer in support of the position put forth? (Identify all pieces of evidence you find.)
- What is the nature of each piece of supporting evidence? For example, is it based on empirical(经验) research, ethical(道德) 
consideration, common knowledge, anecdote(轶事)?
- How convincing(可信度) is the evidence? For example, does the research design adequately(充分的) address the question posed (#1 above)? 
- Are the ethical considerations adequately explored and assessed(被评估)? Have you read or heard anything on this subject that 
confirms or challenges the evidence?
2. Counter(计数器) arguments

- What arguments made in opposition(反对) to the author's views were described?
- Were these arguments persuasively(有说服力) refuted(被驳斥)?
- What evidence was used in the refutation?
3. Effectiveness

- What were the strengths(强度) of the article?
- Was it difficult to read and understand? If so, why? If not, why not?
- Were you able to follow the moves of the article from thesis to evidence, for example?
- Did the structure of sentences and paragraphs and the overall organization guide you and help you follow the author's intent(意图)?
- Did all the material seem relevant to the points made?


Mastering academic reading takes time and practice. We have faith in your ability to improve your academic reading 
skills throughout your undergraduate career, as we are always improving our own. Please be patient with yourself 
(and with our own imperfect scholarly prose). With perseverance(毅力) and hard work, you will hone(磨炼) your skills and will 
learn more and more. Another benefit of improving your critical reading skills is that they will help you become a 
better writer. Go for it!

### 读后感
1. 学术阅读确实需要训练，因此在对看技术文档的时候产生沮丧心理要有预期
2. 另外，重点要看作者的意图，和他为论点作出的论据，否则很容易迷失在trees里。
3. 可信度很重要，其实现在有些论文也不定真假（比如臭名昭著的生物圈），一定要有警惕心。当然，大部分学术论文还是比较可信的。学术圈都如此，自媒体上更不用浪费时间了。
4. 其实时间是检验很多事情的金标准，要有耐心，在新闻类的仓库里争取拨开迷雾，很多人血馒头事件必定会露出马脚的。
