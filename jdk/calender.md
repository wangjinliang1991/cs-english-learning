// Data flow in Calendar
    // ---------------------

    // The current time is represented in two ways by Calendar: as UTC
    // milliseconds from the epoch (1 January 1970 0:00 UTC), and as local
    // fields such as MONTH, HOUR, AM_PM, etc.  It is possible to compute the
    // millis from the fields, and vice versa(反之亦然).  The data needed to do this
    // conversion is encapsulated by a TimeZone object owned by the Calendar.
    // The data provided by the TimeZone object may also be overridden if the
    // user sets the ZONE_OFFSET and/or DST_OFFSET fields directly. The class
    // keeps track of what information was most recently set by the caller, and
    // uses that to compute any other information as needed.

    // If the user sets the fields using set(), the data flow is as follows.
    // This is implemented by the Calendar subclass's computeTime() method.
    // During this process, certain fields may be ignored.  The disambiguation(消除歧义)
    // algorithm(算法) for resolving which fields to pay attention to is described
    // in the class documentation.

    //   local fields (YEAR, MONTH, DATE, HOUR, MINUTE, etc.)
    //           |
    //           | Using Calendar-specific algorithm
    //           V
    //   local standard millis
    //           |
    //           | Using TimeZone or user-set ZONE_OFFSET / DST_OFFSET
    //           V
    //   UTC millis (in time data member)

    // If the user sets the UTC millis using setTime() or setTimeInMillis(),
    // the data flow is as follows.  This is implemented by the Calendar
    // subclass's computeFields() method.

    //   UTC millis (in time data member)
    //           |
    //           | Using TimeZone getOffset()
    //           V
    //   local standard millis
    //           |
    //           | Using Calendar-specific algorithm
    //           V
    //   local fields (YEAR, MONTH, DATE, HOUR, MINUTE, etc.)

    // In general, a round trip(往返) from fields, through local and UTC millis, and
    // back out to fields is made when necessary.  This is implemented by the
    // complete() method.  Resolving a partial set of fields into a UTC millis
    // value allows all remaining fields to be generated from that value.  If
    // the Calendar is lenient(宽容), the fields are also renormalized to standard
    // ranges when they are regenerated.
